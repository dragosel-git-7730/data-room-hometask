# üêõ Debug Instructions for Subfolder Creation

## How to Debug the Issue:

### 1. **Open Browser Console** (`F12`)
You'll now see detailed logs for every operation:
- Folder creation attempts
- Current state information
- Backend operations
- Data persistence

### 2. **Check Debug Panel**
A debug panel now appears in the top-right corner showing:
- Current folder ID
- Total items count
- Items in current folder
- Complete folder structure

### 3. **Test Subfolder Creation:**

**Step by step:**
1. Login with `admin@dataroom.com` / `admin123`
2. Create a folder called "Test Folder" (should work)
3. Click on "Test Folder" to navigate into it
4. Try to create a subfolder called "Sub Folder"
5. Check the console logs and debug panel

### 4. **What to Look For:**

**Console Logs:**
- "Creating folder: [name] in parent: [id]" 
- "Created folder: [object]"
- "Current folder items: [details]"

**Debug Panel:**
- Current Folder should show the folder ID when inside a folder
- Current Items should show 0 when folder is empty
- All Items Structure should show parent-child relationships

### 5. **Common Issues to Check:**

1. **Navigation Issue**: Does clicking a folder actually change the "Current Folder" in debug panel?
2. **Parent ID Issue**: When creating subfolder, does it show the correct parent ID in logs?
3. **State Update Issue**: After creating subfolder, does it appear in "Current Items"?
4. **Persistence Issue**: After page refresh, do subfolders still exist?

### 6. **Manual Test:**

Try this in browser console:
```javascript
// Check current state
console.log('Current localStorage data:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('mockDataRoom') || '{}'));
```

Let me know what you see in the console logs and debug panel when you try to create a subfolder! üîç
