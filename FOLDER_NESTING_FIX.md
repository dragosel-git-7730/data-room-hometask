# 🔧 Folder Nesting Fix - Status Update

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Data Persistence Issues**
- ✅ Added proper `saveData()` calls after folder creation
- ✅ Added proper `saveData()` calls after file uploads
- ✅ Added `loadData()` refresh when getting items
- ✅ Added debug logging to track data flow

### 2. **State Management**
- ✅ Fixed `useDataRoom` hook to refresh items after creation
- ✅ Added `useCallback` for proper dependency management
- ✅ Added state consistency checks

### 3. **Mock Backend Improvements**
- ✅ Enhanced `createFolder()` with proper data saving
- ✅ Enhanced `uploadFile()` with proper data saving  
- ✅ Enhanced `getItems()` to reload fresh data
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging

## 🧪 **Testing Folder Nesting:**

### Step-by-Step Test:
1. **Login** with `admin@dataroom.com` / `admin123`
2. **Create a folder** called "Projects"
3. **Navigate into** "Projects" folder (click on it)
4. **Create a subfolder** called "Client Work" 
5. **Navigate into** "Client Work" 
6. **Create another subfolder** called "Documents"
7. **Upload a PDF** into "Documents"
8. **Refresh the page** - all folders should persist!

### What Should Work Now:
- ✅ **Folders persist** after creation
- ✅ **Nested folders** work properly
- ✅ **Files in nested folders** work
- ✅ **Data survives** page refresh
- ✅ **Breadcrumb navigation** shows path

## 🐛 **Debug Features Added:**

Open browser console to see:
- Folder creation logs
- File upload logs  
- Data persistence logs
- Current folder state
- Items count in each folder

## 🎯 **Key Improvements:**

1. **Persistent Storage**: All changes now save to localStorage immediately
2. **Real-time Updates**: State refreshes after every operation
3. **Nested Structure**: Full folder hierarchy support
4. **Debug Visibility**: Console logs show what's happening

The folder nesting should now work perfectly with full persistence! 🚀
